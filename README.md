### Task-03: Decision Tree Classification

Internship: Data Science Internship – Prodigy InfoTech

---

### Objective
To build a simple Decision Tree classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic and marketing-related features.

---

### Dataset
Source: Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)

Description:
The dataset contains information about bank customers, including age, job, marital status, balance, and past marketing interactions. The target variable indicates whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit.

---

### Data Preparation
- Loaded the dataset using pandas.
- Used the correct separator to read the data properly.
- Converted the target variable into binary form.
- Applied one-hot encoding to categorical features.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

---

### Model
- A Decision Tree Classifier was trained with limited depth to keep the model simple and interpretable.

---

### Evaluation
- Model performance was evaluated using accuracy.
- A confusion matrix was used to visualize prediction results.

---

### Conclusion
This task demonstrates how a basic decision tree model can be used for classification problems and how customer-related features can help predict marketing outcomes.
